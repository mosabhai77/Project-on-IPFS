# Sample Hardhat Project

This project develops a Decentralised application "Meta-drive" that allows users to store and view their files on the IPFS network as well as allows them to share it with other users using the metamask account. We have used PINATA-> which is an NFT media management service that llows users to pin their content on IPFS thereby giving a fast and easy way to both technical and non technical creators to share and manage their files.

The necessary resources needed for this project are:
React.js,ethers,hardhat configuration, Solidity and IPFS.

To deploy the project on your local machine try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node // for running the hardhat local blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js //for deploying the smart contract deploy.js
```
